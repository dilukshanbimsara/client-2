1) Too many re-renders React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop React Error fixed.

error was come from using useState hook.

const[tabNumber, setTabNumber]  = useState(1);

  const selectTab_1 = ()=>{
    setTabNumber(1);
    console.log(tabNumber);
  }

<Button onClick={selectTab_1(1)}> Paid</Button>

as above we directly calling the selectTab_(1) is get above error.

solusion
<Button onClick={()=>selectTab_1()}> Paid</Button>   

call as a arrow function
